# Excel Agents
### Automate Excel‚ÜíPython code extraction using LLM agents

![Excel Agents Logo](assets/logo.jpg)

## Introduction
I started this project to expeirment with a multi-agent workflow that parses information in different cells and uses multiple LLM API calls in proper sequence to convert an engineering calculation Excel spreadsheet into well-documented Python codebase.

## 1. Setup
To run this repo locally, you will need to follow these steps:
- Install [MongoDB Community Server](https://www.mongodb.com/try/download/community) (free)
- Create a virtual Python environment, cd to the project repository and run `pip install -r requirements.txt`
- [OpenAI](https://openai.com/api/) API key
- [LangFuse](https://langfuse.com/) API key (optional and free for limited use)
- Ensure MongoDB is running locally. Try running `mongosh` in the terminal. If you see the server ID, that means the server is running
- Open `.env.example` and add proper credentials for LangFuse and OpenAI APIs. Remove the .example extension after updating the contents of the file

## 2. Getting Started
In what follows, an overview of this agentic workflow is provided. You may also refer to [this notebook](https://github.com/OmidSaj/excel_agent/blob/main/example.ipynb) to reproduce the results for an example spreadsheet. 

### 2.1. Define a Spreadsheet
Start by specifying the path to your Excel spreadsheet as follows. The AI-generated content will be stored in the same directory. You can also use the following default example in the repo:
```python
spreadsheet_name = 'simple_beam'
path = f"examples/simple_beam/{spreadsheet_name}.xlsx"
```

There are two main classes that allow us to orchestrate the agentic workflow:
1. `ExcelVariableAgent`: This class will preprocess an existing Excel spreadsheet, create a database, and dispatch a swarm of agents to study the contents of cells, create variable names for our Python script, and make small Python code blocks for the contents of cells.

2. `ProgrammerAgent`: Once the ExcelVariableAgent workers have finished creating a processed database of cell information, the Programmer will start refactoring the Python code blocks, scaffolding a Python codebase, and finally creating an example script to test the codebase.

### 2.2. ExcelVariableAgent
Create an instance of the variable agent. Running the following cell will start extracting useful information from each cell, including the content, formulas, dependents, and more.

```python
from llm_agents.cell_inspectors import ExcelVariableAgent

variable_agent.graph.visualize(
    figsize=(8, 12),
    node_size=1200,
    title=spreadsheet_name,
    save_path=f"{variable_agent.project_dir}/computegraph_{spreadsheet_name}.png"
)
```

The `variable_agent` will create a computational graph and start processing cells from input root nodes to the output leaf nodes as shown in the following graph:

![Computational Graph](assets/computational_graph.png)

Now, with all the preprocessing out of the way, we can dispatch the army of LLMs to start inspecting cells. For each layer, we call all nodes simultaneously using the async functionality in Python.

üí∏‚ö†Ô∏è Note that running the following cell will cost you money. There will be an API call for every node of your compute graph. If you don't want to make API calls, you can skip running the following cell as the programmer agent will load `variable_db_simple_beam.pkl` for this specific example from the project directory.

```python
await variable_agent.orchestrate_variable_extraction()
```

### 2.3. ProgrammerAgent
While we created some code blocks for the contents of each cell in the previous part, the code blocks are not connected to form a complete and end-to-end graph. We collect the previous code blocks and present them to an object of the `ProgrammerAgent` to generate a higher quality codebase for us.

```python 
from llm_agents.programmer import ProgrammerAgent

programmer = ProgrammerAgent(
    spread_sheet_path=path,
    openai_model="gpt-4.1",
    trace_with_langfuse=True
)
```

After initialization, we can run our agent to create our codebase. The `ProgrammerAgent` can create directories and save code as .py files.

üí∏‚ö†Ô∏è Running the following cell will also cost you money. Feel free to skip it and directly go to the spreadsheet directory to look at the AI-generated content.

```python
messages = await programmer.initialize_coding_agent()
```

### 2.4. Test the Final Results
Go to the spreadsheet project directory and review the code! You will see that our LLM even created a README file to document the project. Additionally, you can run the example.py generated by the LLM to test how it performed. For this specific example, it is recommended to use a larger top-tier LLM with better reasoning capabilities.

## 3. Libraries Used
This project leverages several powerful Python libraries to handle different aspects of the Excel-to-Python conversion process:

- **Excel Processing**:
  - `openpyxl`: For reading and parsing Excel files
  - `formulas`: For parsing Excel formulas and their dependencies
  - `pandas`: For data manipulation and analysis

- **AI and LLM Integration**:
  - `langchain` and `langgraph`: Used tp orchestrate LLM API calls, tool use, ....
Note about the langchain ecosystem:
I chose langchain because if you decided to use another LLM, there is minimal change to the code. It has also integrates well with [ollama](https://ollama.com/) for local llm inference. 
  - `langfuse`: For LLM observability and monitoring


- **Data Storage and Management**:
  - `mongoengine`: MongoDB ODM for storing cell information and processing results
  - `PyYAML`: To configure system prompts

- **Visualization and Utilities**:
  - `networkx`: For creating and managing computational graphs
  - `matplotlib`: For visualizing the computational graphs
  - `tqdm`: For progress tracking
  - `python-dotenv`: For environment variable management

## 4. Future Work
I am planning to expand the capabilities of this project over time. Below is a list of areas for improvement:
* The proposed workflow will not work in cases where some cells reference other spreadsheets
* The agent does not have access to Macro VBA codes. Future work can be done to provide tools that add more context
* The variable agent should be optimized to handle large data cells without formulas more effectively
* To scale the programmer agent to massive spreadsheets, an agentic RAG pipeline can help to better manage large code context

I welcome any feedback or comments!
